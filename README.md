# 8Bitdo Firmware

Firmware for 8Bitdo controllers

_NOTE:_ sometime in 2020, 8BitDo stopped providing downloadable firmware files and switched to an opaque API.
Some information is provided at https://ladis.cloud/blog/posts/firmware-update-8bitdo.html and firmware files 
can now be downloaded using `8bitdo-firmware.py`.

The `.dat` files can be applied using the `ebitdo-tool` binary in fwupd, or the
generated `.cab` files can be installed using `gnome-software` or `fwupdmgr`.

Note: Make sure the GamePad battery is NOT empty before flashing.
